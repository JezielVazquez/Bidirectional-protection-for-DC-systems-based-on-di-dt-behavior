Bidirectional Protection for DC Systems Based on di/dt Behavior

To implement this system, you will need switches controlled by the Texas Instruments DSP TMS320F28379D microcontroller. The code for the microcontroller is located in program.c, and you'll need Code Composer Studio to load it.

You can download Code Composer Studio from the following link:

This program uses a serial interface to communicate with LabVIEW. You can find the LabVIEW program in the "LabVIEW" folder. Download the files, open the program, set the serial speed to 115200 bps, and run it.
